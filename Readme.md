## Project Structurebojadlabalaji: @workspace /setupTests  the base path for the routes as Cyber-Intellect

Workspace: To set the base path for the routes to `Cyber-Intellect`, you need to update the 

Router

 component in your 

App.jsx

 file. Here's the updated file tree structure:



Apply Changes



In 

App.jsx

, update the 

Router

 component to include the `basename` prop:

```jsx
<Router basename="/Cyber-Intellect" future={{ 
  v7_startTransition: true,
  v7_relativeSplatPath: true 
}}>
```

This will set the base path for all routes to `/Cyber-Intellect`.
